## ***Hello darkness [or whiteness~ depending on your Github theme]*** 👋👻

I'm **Mo**. I'm curious about how our **memories** and **emotions** are *malleable* 😔 ➡ 😀

I use this space to store <ins>reproducible scripts</ins> I compiled for my projects 🔭

Also this space moonlights as a portfolio of a *self-taught* coder 🤖

Hope the repositories are of any help [especially to newbie coders] ⚡

Can reach out to me via: [**email**](mailto:mohith96@connect.hku.hk?subject=[GitHub]%20Source%20Han%20Sans) or [**twitter**](https://twitter.com/MohithMVarma) 📫

P.S. My personal website hosted on **Github Pages** will be integrated here soon, until then here's my CV 🐣
