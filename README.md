## ***Hello darkness*** 👋👻

I'm **Mo**. I'm curious about how our **memories** and **emotions** are *malleable* 😔 ➡ 😀

I use this space to store <ins>reproducible scripts</ins> I compiled for my past projects 🔭

Also this space moonlights as a portfolio of a *self-taught* coder 🤖

P.S. My personal website hosted on **Github Pages** will be integrated here soon, until then here's my CV 🐣
