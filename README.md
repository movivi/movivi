## ***Hello*** 👻

I'm **Mo**. I'm interested in *two* lines of research:
* how **adaptive forgetting** regulates **unwanted memories** and **emotions** 😔 --> 😀
* how our **decisions** are shaped and represented in our **memory systems** 😵+⏪ --> 🧐

I use this space to store reproducible scripts [*analysis*/*task*] I compiled for my projects 🔭

Also this space moonlights as a portfolio of a *self-taught* coder 🤖

Hope the repositories are of any help [<ins>especially to newbie coders</ins>] ⚡

Reach out to me via [**email**](mailto:mohith96@connect.hku.hk?subject=[GitHub]%20Source%20Han%20Sans) 📫

P.S. My personal website hosted on **Github Pages** will be integrated here soon, until then here's my [**CV**](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/phnpbsmb39pq7wj0k22ev/MMV_CV_03192024.pdf?rlkey=xr49g0srnkxwwx0dcq0a4j9f5&dl=0) 🐣
